## What is Elvvo?

Elvvo is an interactive and smart traffic management app. It's also an all-in-one traffic solution. Some features include:

- It determines and extracts license plate numbers from images and returns them as a string.
- It detects vehicles in images and videos and returns the count of vehicles detected. According to the count, it says whether the traffic density is low, high, or very high.
- It can detect people in images and videos.
- You can manage traffic offenses committed by drivers with a simple UI.

## How to Use It?

Download or clone the repository locally and store it in a sigle directory.

To use the **MySQL** version, run the `server.py` file present in the `MySQL` folder. To use the **Web Storage** version, run the `server.py` file present in the `Web Storage` folder.

Once done, open your preferred browser and visit `http://localhost:7777`. You can play with Elvvo now!

## What was BorderHacks2021?

BorderHacks was a 36-hour online hackathon hosted by Aislyn Laurent and was sponsored by many companies. This is their [link](https://www.borderhacks2021.devpost.com).

After the hackathon ended, I worked on this project even more and came up with the good-looking UI and integrated the project with MySQL and Web Storage.

I couldn't have possibly worked on this project without the support from my school. My school helped me with the equipment required to complete my project.

## Technologies Used

This application is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I used HTML, CSS, and JS for the front-end and Python for the back-end. I used sample images and videos (found online) to demonstrate and test my project. For the criminal database, I used MySQL and Web Storage.

For the computer vision and OCR (Optical Character Recognition), I used OpenCV and PyTesseract (TesseractOCR) respectively.

The technologies used in making this project are:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python
- MySQL and Web Storage (LocalStorage)
- OpenCV and PyTesseract (Computer Vision and OCR)
- API Requests (REST)

## Challenges I Ran Into

The first one was to download the appropriate images and videos which were compatible with the program. Most of the files downloaded were corrupt or incompatible with the program.

The second one was to find the correct pre-trained models to detect the vehicles and people.

## What's Next for Elvvo

I may include more features in the coming future like fetching the real-time speed of vehicles in a video and accurately extracting the license plate numbers from the provided images.

I am looking forward to develop a database with the license plate numbers and the vehicle owner's contact information to send them personalized alerts to pay fines for an offense they committed.

## External Media

When I originally created Elvvo, I made a small PowerPoint presentation for it. You can view that [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SvfmvYcGw8A6jx_Evs8ZN9_C0nzeWCEY/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109927448714846827229&rtpof=true&sd=true).

I also uploaded a demo video on YouTube. You can chech that out [here](https://youtu.be/38bXPLaae34).
